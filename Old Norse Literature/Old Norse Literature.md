- Grampheme notes: DH is the voiced dental fricative, TH is the unvoiced, OE is the O with umlaut eg Ð,Þ,Ö
## First Lecture
- Different lenses of approach
- Short test at the end
- Next week -- Judy Quinn -> Where do heroes come from? 
	- 3 eda poems
### Viking Expeditions
- circa 900 to 1066
- Runic inscriptions but no written sources from this time
- All from the western branch
- Iceland discovery expedition -- important - 12.-13. century, literature written
- What enabled vikings to spead?
	- Drakarr - War Ship
	- Knarr - Colonisation ship
### Ísland
- Discovery - Snaeland, Gardarshólm, Ísland >- Names, only Ísland stuck
- Settlement - Ingold Arnarson circa 870 - Mythic coloniser
- 20-40k people arrived over 60 years from mostly Norway and some from the British isles
- Source for these are the Book of Icelanders and Book of Settlement by Ari the Learned
- Settlers could take as much land as they could walk around in a day
- Somewhat cooperative way of settling
- There were some Irish monks
- Landníáma -- landtaking
- Laws mainly based on Norwegian ones and addapted them
#### Societal structure
- Free farmers -- Bóndi - They could be free outside of the Norwegian kingdom because the king started collecting taxes circa 9th century
- Leaders -- Höfðingi - Local, bigger farmers
- Slaves - From the British isles, many celts

- Later more hierarchy evolved
- Godi -- Chieftans
- Priests, Clergy
- 5 Families consolidated power in the 13th century and Iceland fell under Norwegian rule which ended the free Icelandic state period
##### Establishment of the Althing
- Local assemblies -- Þings
- Iceland - Same system
- 930 - One central assembly = AlÞing, at the assembly plains = Þingvellir
- Law based on Norwegian model
- Problems taken to AlÞing if they could not be resolved by local Things
- No records
#### Adoption of Christianity
- In the year 1000 officially, but reality is fuzzier
- This meant one law for the all of Iceland, christian of course
- It was not banned to be pagan but not in public only at home
- Writing came with it
- They wrote down even the pagan/folk texts because it was so removed from the world
- Christian texts too but Sagas and myth, this is unique in all of europe
- They wrote in Old Norse and not Latin, there was very little Latin
- Language evolution -- Added two leters to the latin alphabet: Þ, Ð - which they took from their runic alphabet
- Many gods - Christ, Thor etc., no contradiction
- Education of the people - priests got educated in Norway
- Schools started popping up, even lay people could attend, which was not the case in most places in europe
- That is one of the reasons for folk literature being so aviable to us
### Genres of Old Norse Literature
- 12. - 14. century
- Old Norse language
- Poetry
	- Skaldic poems -- Known authorship
		- Complicated metres, thus the structure is very hard to change -- Could theoretically preserve the form from before it was written down
		- Started at the court of Norwegian kings, 9th century
		- Oral form, written down many centuries later (12th onward)
		- Helps with reconstructing pronounciation and helps date the poems
	- The Poetic Edda -- Mythological and heroic songs
		- Codex Regius
		- Simpler poetic meters
		- If not for theis, the mythology would be lost
#### Pagan religion
- Two families of gods:
	- Aesir: Odin, Thor, Baldr - some speculate that the germanic people introduced these
	- Vanir: Frey, Freyja, Njörd - some speculate that this is the older layer connected to fertility and germanic people adopted them
- Younger Edda - Prosaic - Snorri Sturluson 
	- Skald handbook with mythological content 
	- beggining of 13th century
	- Wanted to preserve Skaldic poetry because it was dying out
	- Skald importance was waying
	- Kennings - forms to fit the metre
	- Snorri was educated and read a lot of mainland literature and he retells the Edda in that style
	- He explained the gods rationally which the older Edda did not, it did not even question why the gods did what they did
- Yggdrasil
##### Mythological lays
- Heroic petry epics
- Only comprehensive sources of the pagan mythology
- Titles:
	- Völuspá - The seeress's Prophecy
	- Hávamál - Sayings of the High One (Ódin)
	- Vafþrúðnismál - Vafthrudnir's Sayings
	- Grímnismál - Grimms Sayings
- 10 in total
- Prophecies could be invented in the 13th century due to christinisation but some claim they could be actual old pagan prophecies -- Thats why different approaches are important so you can make up your mind
- Lot of contention on how accurate the Edda is
- Preserved also in England: Beowulf, Widsith etc.; Germany: Song of Hildebrand, Song of the Nibelungs
- READ: first 3 Helgi poems
#### Sagas
- Prosaic genre
- Specific for Iceland and Norway
- Genres:
	- King/Royal -- konungasögur
		- Preserve royal deeds
		- Inspired by Hagiographies - Saint stories
	- Family -- íslendingasögur
		- Describes lives of first Icelanders, taking place in that period (870-930), written down also centuries later
		- For sure changed a lot
		- Places and names on Iceland
		- Sagas abour discovering america (Vineland)
		- Again, it is contested whether it is simply art or real attestations but most likely there is some truth
	- Legendary -- fornaldarsögur
		- Take place out of Iceland
		- Take place before the settlement
		- Written down later than the Kingly and Familial stories
		- Supernatural stuff
	- Chivalric -- riddarasögur
		- Translated european stories and Indigenous Icelandic sagas
		- Translated
			- Fixed form
			- Quite good translations
			- Some are word for word with mainland versions
			- Shows what the translator had to change for comprehensibility
		- Indigenous
			- Dont pretend to be historical
			- Quite funny with interesting stories
	- Contemporary + Bishops -- samtídasögur
		- Written in the time of writing (circa 13th century)
		- Describe Iceland at that time
		- Last days of the Icelandic free state
		- Describe how the democratic system fell

## Second lecture -- Judy Quinn
- Why they were still relevant
- Pre christian mythology -- death in battle
- Prose inbetween poetry might be newer eg. reincarnation at end of 3rd poem of Helgi
- Edda written down during transition to Norwegian rule -- Might be influenced by that
- Law-speaker -- person who memorized all laws - only official
- 999 - adoption of christianity
- 1118-19 - law written down
- Laws copied and changed across iceland -- different versions
	- The real law was what the bishops had
	- Law-speaker is not mentioned anymore and were replaced by them
	- 2 Bishops
		- Longest version of the law was the real one
	- 2 equally long laws -- Skálholt Bishops is the real one
- Homeostasis -- Preliterary culture is transformed during literacy -- what was deemed irrelevant is discarted
	- Thus the poetry had to have meant something
- Snorri Sturluson -- Lawmaker, Law-speaker
	- Wrote about the mythology and poetry on iceland
	- During civil war
	- Was murdered by a servant of the Norwegian king
	- Only copies from a century later were written down
		- Different versions
### Warrior-gods relationship
- Æsir vs. Jötnar -- 2 families of gods
	 - Ragna rök -- destinies of the powers
- Æsir recruit human warriors to Valhöll to defeat the Jötnar
- Valkyrja -- She-chooser of the slain
	- Chooses best warrior on Valhöl to marry (Helgi says sure)
	- Chosen by Valkyrja means you die unless she marries you
	- Both human and divine
	- Did not dissaper with adoption in Christianity at least in literature -- Cultural paganism
		- Possibly parallels with angels
- Metre
	- Alliteration only per line -- Fornirðislag
	- Long Short lines
- Codex Regius -- pretty rough shape
	- Not commisioned by a very wealthy person
	- first third is about gods
	- rest is about the human world
	- Author tried to tie the poems together with the prose
### Helgi
- Senna -- insult exchange
	- Make up large portions of the poems
	- Nver directly Helgi but his men
	- Almost never resolves -- ends in a real fight
		- Only middle senna is resolved
		- Giantess turns to stone
- 3 poems with parallel plots
- About what makes a great leader
- Helgi and Valkyrie apparently reincarnated over and over
	- Compiler says that reincarnation was in the ancient times but in their time he calls it a delusion
