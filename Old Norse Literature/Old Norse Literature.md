- Grampheme notes: DH is the voiced dental fricative, TH is the unvoiced, OE is the O with umlaut eg Ð,Þ,Ö

## First Lecture
- Different lenses of approach
- Short test at the end
- Next week -- Judy Quinn -> Where do heroes come from? 
	- 3 eda poems

### Viking Expeditions
- circa 900 to 1066
- Runic inscriptions but no written sources from this time
- All from the western branch
- Iceland discovery expedition -- important - 12.-13. century, literature written
- What enabled vikings to spead?
	- Drakarr - War Ship
	- Knarr - Colonisation ship

### Ísland
- Discovery - Snaeland, Gardarshólm, Ísland >- Names, only Ísland stuck
- Settlement - Ingold Arnarson circa 870 - Mythic coloniser
- 20-40k people arrived over 60 years from mostly Norway and some from the British isles
- Source for these are the Book of Icelanders and Book of Settlement by Ari the Learned
- Settlers could take as much land as they could walk around in a day
- Somewhat cooperative way of settling
- There were some Irish monks
- Landníáma -- landtaking
- Laws mainly based on Norwegian ones and addapted them

#### Societal structure
- Free farmers -- Bóndi - They could be free outside of the Norwegian kingdom because the king started collecting taxes circa 9th century
- Leaders -- Höfðingi - Local, bigger farmers
- Slaves - From the British isles, many celts

- Later more hierarchy evolved
- Godi -- Chieftans
- Priests, Clergy
- 5 Families consolidated power in the 13th century and Iceland fell under Norwegian rule which ended the free Icelandic state period

##### Establishment of the Althing
- Local assemblies -- Þings
- Iceland - Same system
- 930 - One central assembly = AlÞing, at the assembly plains = Þingvellir
- Law based on Norwegian model
- Problems taken to AlÞing if they could not be resolved by local Things
- No records

#### Adoption of Christianity
- In the year 1000 officially, but reality is fuzzier
- This meant one law for the all of Iceland, christian of course
- It was not banned to be pagan but not in public only at home
- Writing came with it
- They wrote down even the pagan/folk texts because it was so removed from the world
- Christian texts too but Sagas and myth, this is unique in all of europe
- They wrote in Old Norse and not Latin, there was very little Latin
- Language evolution -- Added two leters to the latin alphabet: Þ, Ð - which they took from their runic alphabet
- Many gods - Christ, Thor etc., no contradiction
- Education of the people - priests got educated in Norway
- Schools started popping up, even lay people could attend, which was not the case in most places in europe
- That is one of the reasons for folk literature being so aviable to us

### Genres of Old Norse Literature
- 12. - 14. century
- Old Norse language
- Poetry
	- Skaldic poems -- Known authorship
		- Complicated metres, thus the structure is very hard to change -- Could theoretically preserve the form from before it was written down
		- Started at the court of Norwegian kings, 9th century
		- Oral form, written down many centuries later (12th onward)
		- Helps with reconstructing pronounciation and helps date the poems
	- The Poetic Edda -- Mythological and heroic songs
		- Codex Regius
		- Simpler poetic meters
		- If not for theis, the mythology would be lost

#### Pagan religion
- Two families of gods:
	- Aesir: Odin, Thor, Baldr - some speculate that the germanic people introduced these
	- Vanir: Frey, Freyja, Njörd - some speculate that this is the older layer connected to fertility and germanic people adopted them
- Younger Edda - Prosaic - Snorri Sturluson 
	- Skald handbook with mythological content 
	- beggining of 13th century
	- Wanted to preserve Skaldic poetry because it was dying out
	- Skald importance was waying
	- Kennings - forms to fit the metre
	- Snorri was educated and read a lot of mainland literature and he retells the Edda in that style
	- He explained the gods rationally which the older Edda did not, it did not even question why the gods did what they did
- Yggdrasil

##### Mythological lays
- Heroic petry epics
- Only comprehensive sources of the pagan mythology
- Titles:
	- Völuspá - The seeress's Prophecy
	- Hávamál - Sayings of the High One (Ódin)
	- Vafþrúðnismál - Vafthrudnir's Sayings
	- Grímnismál - Grimms Sayings
- 10 in total
- Prophecies could be invented in the 13th century due to christinisation but some claim they could be actual old pagan prophecies -- Thats why different approaches are important so you can make up your mind
- Lot of contention on how accurate the Edda is
- Preserved also in England: Beowulf, Widsith etc.; Germany: Song of Hildebrand, Song of the Nibelungs
- READ: first 3 Helgi poems

#### Sagas
- Prosaic genre
- Specific for Iceland and Norway
- Genres:
	- King/Royal -- konungasögur
		- Preserve royal deeds
		- Inspired by Hagiographies - Saint stories
	- Family -- íslendingasögur
		- Describes lives of first Icelanders, taking place in that period (870-930), written down also centuries later
		- For sure changed a lot
		- Places and names on Iceland
		- Sagas abour discovering america (Vineland)
		- Again, it is contested whether it is simply art or real attestations but most likely there is some truth
	- Legendary -- fornaldarsögur
		- Take place out of Iceland
		- Take place before the settlement
		- Written down later than the Kingly and Familial stories
		- Supernatural stuff
	- Chivalric -- riddarasögur
		- Translated european stories and Indigenous Icelandic sagas
		- Translated
			- Fixed form
			- Quite good translations
			- Some are word for word with mainland versions
			- Shows what the translator had to change for comprehensibility
		- Indigenous
			- Dont pretend to be historical
			- Quite funny with interesting stories
	- Contemporary + Bishops -- samtídasögur
		- Written in the time of writing (circa 13th century)
		- Describe Iceland at that time
		- Last days of the Icelandic free state
		- Describe how the democratic system fell

## Second lecture -- Judy Quinn
- Why they were still relevant
- Pre christian mythology -- death in battle
- Prose inbetween poetry might be newer eg. reincarnation at end of 3rd poem of Helgi
- Edda written down during transition to Norwegian rule -- Might be influenced by that
- Law-speaker -- person who memorized all laws - only official
- 999 - adoption of christianity
- 1118-19 - law written down
- Laws copied and changed across iceland -- different versions
	- The real law was what the bishops had
	- Law-speaker is not mentioned anymore and were replaced by them
	- 2 Bishops
		- Longest version of the law was the real one
	- 2 equally long laws -- Skálholt Bishops is the real one
- Homeostasis -- Preliterary culture is transformed during literacy -- what was deemed irrelevant is discarted
	- Thus the poetry had to have meant something
- Snorri Sturluson -- Lawmaker, Law-speaker
	- Wrote about the mythology and poetry on iceland
	- During civil war
	- Was murdered by a servant of the Norwegian king
	- Only copies from a century later were written down
		- Different versions

### Warrior-gods relationship
- Æsir vs. Jötnar -- 2 families of gods
	 - Ragna rök -- destinies of the powers
- Æsir recruit human warriors to Valhöll to defeat the Jötnar
- Valkyrja -- She-chooser of the slain
	- Chooses best warrior on Valhöl to marry (Helgi says sure)
	- Chosen by Valkyrja means you die unless she marries you
	- Both human and divine
	- Did not dissaper with adoption in Christianity at least in literature -- Cultural paganism
		- Possibly parallels with angels
- Metre
	- Alliteration only per line -- Fornirðislag
	- Long Short lines
- Codex Regius -- pretty rough shape
	- Not commisioned by a very wealthy person
	- first third is about gods
	- rest is about the human world
	- Author tried to tie the poems together with the prose

### Helgi
- Senna -- insult exchange
	- Make up large portions of the poems
	- Nver directly Helgi but his men
	- Almost never resolves -- ends in a real fight
		- Only middle senna is resolved
		- Giantess turns to stone
- 3 poems with parallel plots
- About what makes a great leader
	- Mythological resolution of this -- divinely touched are usually the better leaders
- Helgi and Valkyrie apparently reincarnated over and over
	- Compiler says that reincarnation was in the ancient times but in their time he calls it a delusion


## Third lecture -- Madita Knöpfle -- Narratology
- Pre modern literary practices x theory

### Historical situatedness
- Literature -- Bókmenntir
	- Written and spoken
	- Also means history to some extent
	- Before the 19th century it meant scholarship -- Connected with nationbuilding
	- Skáldskapr -- old word that might be more simlar to the concept of literatture
- Premodern
	- Manuscripts till 19th century on Iceland
	- Single copies
	- Public or social readings - No time for reading as a leisure
		- Texts composed differently to be better for reading aloud
	- Read orally or aloud
	- No concept of author -- texts altered
- Sagnaskemtun -- saga enterntainment
- Different versions of sagas
- Untill 18th century -- only church could print -- handwritten secular texts
- Radio replaced evening wakes -- oral homely readings
- First Icelandic novel -- 1850 -- Piltur og Stúlka

### Theory
- Classical narratologies
	- Text-centered grammar of narrative
	- Assumed all texts had a sort of grammar of story
	- Developed on modern novels
	- Diachronic narr.
- Post-classical narratologies
	- Context-Oriented tool
	- Post-structuralist (Feminist, postcolonial..)
	- 2000s
	- Synchronic narr.
	- Rhetorics
	- Each time has its own aproach
- They do not exclude eachother
- (Wolf Schmid - Narratology -- 2010)
- Monika Fludernik -- Diachronization of narratology
	- Evolution of scene shifts in 50 historical english texts
	- Middle ages -- for listeners
	- Shift from rhetorical device to a que or refference to saga traddition

### Analysis
- "Nú er þar máls at taka" -- "Now let us speak of"
	- Many translations depending on interpretation of the device
	- Personal v. impersonal translations -- ie. "Now the tale is to be taken up"
- Aphodos -- Sideplot to main story transition
	- Nunc ad cetera, unde incepimus, regrediamur -- Adam of bremen I:17
- Nú er þar máls at taka
	- Homily book
		- 1200s 
		- shift of topic 
		- sermon
	- Njáls saga 
		- 1400s 
		- Returns story to a character that was introduced in the beginning but the plot went on withouth her
	- Huldarsaga
		- 1800s
		- Newly composed saga based on a mentioned lost saga
		- Might have been used as a stylistic device to sound closer to mediaval sagas
	- Piltur og stúlka
		- 1850
		- Tie different parts of the story
		- Phrases from sagas used in a text that was designed to be read quietly
		- Ends in a sagic way as well
	- Kristinhald undir Jökli
		- 1968
		- Generic cue
		- Characters in novel compared to characters made up in old stories

## Did vikings have a soul?
- Saul (Saiwalo), Líkamr (Lichunhamo) -- From christianity
- Hamr -- Protobaltofinnic - Skin, Gestalt, Chemise
	- Original conception of what a being is
	- Used in literature during:
		- Overcoming obstacles -- Flying
		- Fighting -- Increasing strenght -- Berserker - Not of one shape -- Eigi Einhamr -> They hamask
		- Magic -- Shapeshifters - No specified hamr
	- Hamför -- Journey of hamr
	- Hamslauss -- Person out of their mind
	- Hamstolin -- Shapeless/Mindless
	- Hamingja -- Happiness (in Icelandic)
- Change towards a body-soul distinction?
	- Originally no distinction in hamr propably
		- í trollz hami (In a trollish shape) -- Seeress's prophecy
			- Both mental and real shape
		- í arnar ham -- Eagleish shape/property -- Vaftrúðnismál -> But in Snorra Edda -- it is interpreted as someone being physically eagle-like
	- Hamr as a state of mind connected to body state
		- berserk's fury -- hamrammr
			- Connected to animal shapes
			- Ber - serkir -- bear + skirts
			- Úlf - heðnar -- wolf + skins
		- Berserkers change their mental shape to get strenght
		- Archæological evidence - depiction of animal-headed fighters, fighter fighting bears
		- Cult of furious warriors already in germanic areas on continental europe
		- Possibly furries?
		- Hamrammr could mean werewolf in some contexts
	- Hamr as a physical meaning but still some mental aspects
		- Völsunga saga
			- Sigmund
			- Úlfhamir -- wolf skins
			- Wolf nature comes over people
	- Hamr as physical only
		- heimskringla - Snorri Sturluson
			- Óðin skipti hömum -- Odin could change his shape
		- Christianised thinking
		- Later sagas
			- vargs hamnum - wolf's hamr
			- fiaðrhamr - flying contraption
	- Hamr as mental only
		- Egils saga -- sem hamstoli væri -- (and was) as one posessed -- "as if hamr was stolen"
		- Bærings saga -- hamstoli -- lost his mind -- hamr was stolen
		- Hamr = Inner shape
	- => Concept of identity changes
	- It was a tradition not influenced by greek ideas of the soul
		- If you change your mind you change your body
	- The eyes sometimes remain the same

- Many words for anthropologic beings
- Hierarchy of giants in sagas
- Jötnar - primeval giants -- cosmological beings

- Modern reception of trolls
	- 2 Strains
		- 1. Tolkien
			- Vage concept mixed up with giants
			- Trick turns them into stone - Alvíssmál -- dwarf turns into stone - only instance
			- Way less sources in the 30s - 50s
			- Changed concept of what trolls are in modern times
			- Very christian concept of trolls
			- Trolls spread into fantasy
			- No humour :( -- in sagas they are a sarcastic commentary on humans

## Concept of friendship in old norse society
- political aliances -- contractual friendship
	- vinfengi, vinátta -- sort of an aliance
	- Increase importance beyond family
	- A political/work relationship basically
	- Gifts and feasts
- The process of exchange was private but not hidden
- Status was tied to the amount of relations you could manage
- The church was also involved
- This resulted in a horizontal-ish societal structure
- There was no difference between secular and church elites

### Jómsvíkingasaga
- Járl Hákon -- friendship with king who previously helped opponent


### Gifts
- Fundaental role in maintaining vinátta
- It was expected to gift in exchange for recieving
	- If you could not gift back materially you owed loyalty to the gifter
- Refusal of a gift is significant -- it is conflict


### Feasts
- Used to strenghten friendships as well
- Not coming is rude, not being invited must have sucked
- Used to form the hierarchy which otherwise was kinda loose -- seating order
- Feast is the place and gift is the tool of forming vinátta


### Oaths
- Performs an alliance by taking the oath


- This relationship system changed slower than for example the official religion so we van be pretty sure that even the scribes in the 13th century it was written down almost unchanged

## Emotions in sagas
- The psychology is never described, it is only alluded to via physical means
- In poetry it is
- Physical tokens of emotions
	- Grief is described with exhaustion or the inability to move -- laying in bed
	- Anger is described with preassure, swelling, temperature
	- Death is described with bursting -- death due to emotional causes
- Emotion is literally a part of your body

## Materiality: The aura of the text - Juerg Glauser
- Mediality - what was media in premodern times
- Philology - study of language + textual witnesses
	- Used to study the "Original" manuscript
	- Copied by hand -- each one is unique -> impossible to find the original
- Since 80s-90s -> look at as many variations of a text as possible
	- = New philology
	- Reflects 'Manuscript culture' -- hand copying
- Printing press -> stable texts
- Aura of a text
	- Eminates from the object
	- Materiality of the object
	- It's effect on the audience
	- = 'Charisma' -- "Powerful book" ie. Religious or big science books
		- close to holyness
	- Rune stones -- auratic character
		- Stand out and attract people
		- Aura quired through their age
	- For an object to have aura it needs to be material
	- Halo -- pointing out the aura of a saint
		- Same with books
	- Aura is created by a combination of the senses
	- Beautiful objects can aquire aura more easily?
	- The books do not exist neutrally -- performativity of ritual readings - created between the text, the reader, the audience

### Authority
1. - just a book -> oath of the chancelor -- now it is powerful
	- The original needs to be used or it is not lawful
	- Visually not striking at all but still auratic because of it's power
2. - Papal bull -- Uppsala cathedral -- 1250
	- St. Peter and St. Paul on the lead
	- Confirms church's privileges
3. - Aaldre Vaastgoetalagen -- Westrogothic law -- circa 1300
	- Oldest text in old Swedish
	- Also most likely used in a performative ritualistic way
4. - Thet Nyia Testamentit poa Swensko -- 1526
	- New testament in swedish
	- Protestant -- Only the word is important - not the catholic institution
	- Propably first _official_ translation into another language other than latin
5. - Complete bible -- vernacular -- 1533 l.G. - 1550 D.
	- Danish and Low german

### Performativity
- No known author for medieval texts
- 9th - 10th -- Christianisation -> transition from oral to written tradition
- Books represented in art -- Saints with books
- Abbey plan -- ideal Abbey
	- Closest to the altar - Scriptorium and Library
	- Infra sedes scribentium / supra bibliotheca

### Materiality
1. Codex gigas - 13th century -- Bohemia
	- Largest medieval manuscript -- 92cm - 72kg
2. Birgitta Andersson's prayer book - 1518-32
	- Visual representation of christ's wounds
3. - Voar Herres pinobok -- book of passion
	- Text hiddent under an illumination -> guide on what to read and when
4. - Hjertebogen -- 1550s
	- Shaped like a heart
	- Ballads of love
	- Danish

- Aura is always connected to the usage of the object

### Aura
- Books used as symbols of status and power
- Book of Gospels - 1140s
	- St. patron of bookmakers - Laurencius
- Dalbybog -- book of gospels - 1100s
- Same text - different function - different aura
