### Viking Expeditions
- circa 900 to 1066
- Runic inscriptions but no written sources from this time
- All from the western branch
- Iceland discovery expedition -- important - 12.-13. century, literature written
- What enabled vikings to spead?
	- Drakarr - War Ship
	- Knarr - Colonisation ship
### Ísland
- Discovery - Snaeland, Gardarshólm, Ísland >- Names, only Ísland stuck
- Settlement - Ingold Arnarson circa 870 - Mythic coloniser
- 20-40k people arrived over 60 years from mostly Norway and some from the British isles
- Source for these are the Book of Icelanders and Book of Settlement by Ari the Learned
- Settlers could take as much land as they could walk around in a day
- Somewhat cooperative way of settling
- There were some Irish monks
- Landníáma -- landtaking
- Laws mainly based on Norwegian ones and addapted them
#### Societal structure
- Free farmers -- Bóndi - They could be free outside of the Norwegian kingdom because the king started collecting taxes circa 9th century
- Leaders -- Hoefdhingi - Local, bigger farmers
- Slaves - From the British isles, many celts

- Later more hierarchy evolved
- Godi -- Chieftans
- Priests, Clergy
- 5 Families consolidated power in the 13th century and Iceland fell under Norwegian rule which ended the free Icelandic state period
##### Establishment of the Althing
- Local assemblies -- Things
- Iceland - Same system
- 930 - One central assembly = Althing, at the assembly plains = Thingvellir
- Law based on Norwegian model
- Problems taken to Althing if they could not be resolved by local Things
- No records
#### Adoption of Christianity
- In the year 1000 officially, but reality is fuzzier
- This meant one law for the all of Iceland, christian of course
- It was not banned to be pagan but not in public only at home
- Writing came with it
- They wrote down even the pagan/folk texts because it was so removed from the world
- Christian texts too but Sagas and myth, this is unique in all of europe
- They wrote in Old Norse and not Latin, there was very little Latin
- Language evolution -- Added two leters: TH, DH
- Many gods - Christ, Thor etc., no contradiction
- Education of the people - priests got educated in Norway
- Schools started popping up, even lay people could attend, which was not the case in most places in europe
- That is one of the reasons for folk literature being so aviable to us
### Genres of Old Norse Literature
- 12. - 14. century
- Old Norse language
- Poetry
	- Skaldic poems -- Known authorship
		- Complicated metres, thus the structure is very hard to change -- Could theoretically preserve the form from before it was written down
		- Started at the court of Norwegian kings, 9th century
		- Oral form, written down many centuries later (12th onward)
		- Helps with reconstructing pronounciation and helps date the poems
	- The Poetic Edda -- Mythological and heroic songs
		- Codex Regius
		- Simpler poetic meters
		- If not for theis, the mythology would be lost
#### Pagan religion
- Two families of gods:
	- Aesir: Odin, Thor, Baldr - some speculate that the germanic people introduced these
	- Vanir: Frey, Freyja, Njoerd - some speculate that this is the older layer connected to fertility and germanic people adopted them
- Younger Edda - Prosaic - Snorri Sturluson 
	- Skald handbook with mythological content 
	- beggining of 13th century
	- Wanted to preserve Skaldic poetry because it was dying out
	- Skald importance was waying
	- Kennings - forms to fit the metre
	- Snorri was educated and read a lot of mainland literature and he retells the Edda in that style
	- He explained the gods rationally which the older Edda did not, it did not even question why the gods did what they did
- Yggdrasil
##### Mythological lays
- Heroic petry epics
- Only comprehensive sources of the pagan mythology
- Titles:
	- Voeluspá - The seeress's Prophecy
	- Hávamál - Sayings of the High One (Ódin)
	- Vafthrúdhnismál - Vafthrudnir's Sayings
	- Grímnismál - Gromms Sayings
- 10 in total
- Prophecies could be invented in the 13th century due to christinisation but some claim they could be actual old pagan prophecies -- Thats why different approaches are important so you can make up your mind
- Lot of contention on how accurate the Edda is
- Preserved also in England: Beowulf, Widsith etc.; Germany: Song of Hildebrand, Song of the Nibelungs
- READ: first 3 Helgi poems

		- Describes lives of first Icelanders, taking place in that period (870-930), written down also centuries later
		- For sure changed a lot
		- Places and names on Iceland
		- Sagas abour discovering america (Vineland)
		- Again, it is contested whether it is simply art or real attestations but most likely there is some truth
	- Legendary -- fornaldarsoegur

		- Take place before the settlement
		- Written down later than the Kingly and Familial stories
		- Supernatural stuff
